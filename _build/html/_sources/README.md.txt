<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project consists in building a simulation where our detectibot takes on the appereance of a real robot, roaming into a phisical environment (differentlwy from what occured in the first project ) containing hints.

There are four different positions in the environment (x,y,z respectively) that contains hints:
If the *cluedo_link* of the robot is reasonably close, this will trigger the oracle for the generation of a hint 

> **REMARK** x and y coordinates where known a priori as shown in the table below   

  | room  | x,y coordinates  | z coordinate |
  |--|--|--|
  | FirstMarkerPosition | ( -3,0 ) | 0.75 v 1.25  |
  | SecondMarkerPosition | ( +3,0 ) | 0.75 v 1.25 |
  | ThirdMarkerPosition | ( 0,-3 ) | 0.75 v 1.25  |
  | FourthMarkerPosition | ( 0, +3 ) | 0.75 v 1.25 |
 
Having differen values for z, it is needed that detectibot reaches both quotes with its cluedo_link

Concerining the simulation environment, there are small walls around the robot aimed at impeding the movements of its mobile base 

Hence the robot moves from one «hint» coordinate to another one, while receiving hints. This holds until it has a complete
and consistent hypothesis

<!-- Note about  consistent huèothesis -->

 Please consider that **consistent hypothesis** have been defined as COMPLETED but NOT INCONSISTENT 

> *REMARK* A consistent hypothesis is  defined as *completed* when there occurs one role for each class (i.e., one occourence of what, one occourence for who, one occourence for where ). 
A straightforward example of such hypothesis is [ID2][12], whose definition is here below reported

```txt
ID2_1: ['where', 'Study']
ID2_2: ['who', 'Col.Mustard']
ID2_3: ['what', 'Rope']
```

> *REMARK* An hypothesis, is defined as *inconsistent* when there occurs more than one role for each class (i.e. 2 or more occourences of who, where, what) 

A clear example of such hypothesis is ID4  whose definition is here below reported

```txt
ID4_1: ['where', 'Library']
ID4_2: ['who', 'Mrs.White']
ID4_3: ['what', 'LeadPipe']
ID4_4: ['where', 'Diningroom']
```
### Assignment's prerequisites

As in the first assignment:
- only one ID source is the trustable one. 
- Whenever a robot gets a complete hypothesis, it should go in the center of the arena 
- Once the center has been reached, it should «tell» its solution (as in the first assignment). 
- If the solution is the **correct one**, the game ends
- it is strictly required to use ROSPlan here, to plan the behaviour of your
robot. 
- create a pddl domain, problem and a set of actions 
- the robot of the model has no limitations, meaning that it can be modelled in whatever fashion

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Under the following sections, the software architecture is briefly introduced, along with the prerequisites and installation procedures. Then, a quick video demonstration showing the overall functioning is provided and system’s limitations are discussed

### Installation procedure

> :warning: To avoid further issues, please use this docker image provided by our professors 

```sh
docker run -it -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 --name MyDockerContainer carms84/exproblab

```
Also remember to update and upgrade the container

```sh
sudo apt get update

## ROS node description: An overview 

Here there is the UML components diagram of the project

<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/component_diagram.jpg" >

Some remarks about the aformentioned components diagram:
- The main node simply keeps replanning until the mistery gets solved
- The rosplan block represents a set of nodes provided by the Rosplan framework
- The component action_interface represents a moltitude of nodes, each implementing one pddl action 

As shown in the above component diagram, this software architechture relies on the synergy of varius modules: 



- [cluedo_kb.py][20]              <!-- PLEASE INSERT HERE -->

- [go_to_point.py][21]            <!-- PLEASE INSERT HERE -->

- [main.py][22]                   <!-- PLEASE INSERT HERE -->

- [action_interface.cpp][20]      <!-- PLEASE INSERT HERE -->

- [manipulation.cpp][21]          <!-- PLEASE INSERT HERE -->


Here below we can find the nodes devoted for testing purposes 

- [my_simulation.cpp][26]
- [test_nav.py][23]               
  

### ROS node description: the go_to_point.py node  🪢

Let's start with the `go_to_point.py` node

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/erl_assignment_go_to_point_py.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

It implements a ROS service, whose purpose is that of piloting the robot toward a specific target by following a straight line. As it is shown by the component diagram here reported, it subscribes to the `/odom` topic for retrieving the current robot position and once the robot orientation among x and y coordinates has been computed with respect to the target position (obtained by means of the ros parameter server), it publishes on the `/cmd_vel` topic

Concerning the ros parameters:
`des_pos_x` and `des_pos_y` are used for keeping track of the target goal to be assigned to the robot in the go_to_point.py node 

Node interfaces: 
```Plain txt

Publications: 
 * /cmd_vel [geometry_msgs/Twist]
 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

Subscriptions: 
 * /clock [rosgraph_msgs/Clock]
 * /odom [nav_msgs/Odometry]

Services:

```
### ROS node description: the main.py node 🪢

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/erl_assignment_2_main_py.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

This node represents three core structures, even the "brain" of our achitechture. Being ROSPlan a framework  that owns a variety of nodes which encapsulate planning, problem generation and plan execution, a set of clients have been initialised to, subsequently:

- generate a problem: a [pddl problem][115] is published on a topic 
- establish a plan: a planner is called for  publishing the plan to a topic 
- parse a plan: At this stage the PDDL plan is converted into ROS messages, ready to be executed
- dispatch a plan:  for being then executed 

There is also the possibility to update the Knowledge base (being it the main responsible for the PDDL domain model amd current problem istance stroage)

Indeed, if detectibot is not able to solve the mistery at the first round, it is possible to count on a "replanning phase", after which it starts roaming around the environment for gathering hints held by the markers

Node Interfaces:
```Plain txt 

```
### ROS node description: the cluedo_kb.py node 🪢

Concerning the `cluedo_kb.py` node:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/erl_assignment_2_cluedo_kb_py.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

cluedo_KB is a node that acts as a dedicated ontology for the problem under investigation; it provides a processing/reasoning system that provides the functionalities of:

- registering the clues
- building and processing hypotheses based on the added information
- finding possible solutions to the case
- rejecting hypotheses

> ***REMARK*** the KB listens in on the oracle's topic and as soon as the oracle transmits the clue, the KB adds the message to the ontology without the need for an explicit request

Node interfaces:
```Plain txt
```

### ROS node description: the action_interface.cpp node  🪢

Concerning the `action_interface.cpp` node:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v2/erl_assignment_2_action_interface_cpp_v2.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

action_interface.cpp implements all rosplan actions in a single ROS node, moreover:

- the same node can be run replicated for all actions specified in the pddl
- topics and services only get allocated when the action is called for the first time via the rosplan action dispatcher
- the node interacts with the navigation and manipulation systems to move the robot and the arm
- The node also interacts with the KB and the oracle for clue and hypothesis processing operations

Regarding the pddl, it is possible to see their logical implementation within the domain file, inside the [detectibot_pddl][116] folder. There you can find both the predicates and seven actions, namely:

1. leave_temple
2. shift_gripper
3. gather_hint
4. go_to_wp
5. reach_temple
6. check_consistent_hypo
7. query_hypo

here below it is possible to see the conntent of the soultion found. If you wamt to take a look at the file itself, just [click here][117]

### ROS node description: the manipulation.cpp node 🪢

Concerning the `manipulation_cpp` node:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/erl_assignment_2_manipulation_cpp.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

This node is simply devoted to control the Detectibot's manipulator by directly interacting with the MoveIt! framework


Node interfaces:
```Plain txt

### ROS node description: my_simulation.cpp node 🪢

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/fedehub/ExperimentalRoboticsAssignment2/blob/main/media/component_diagrams/v1/erl2_my_simulation_cpp.jpg" width= 500 height=500>
</p>

This is the node provided by professor with some simplification in orderr to make the siumulation run faster and test wheter the detectibot would have carry out the investigation entirely.

## Working hypothesis and environment 

The  architecture  is designed for providing a raw simplification of the Cluedo Game. Hints are set a-priori and the True hipothesis is  randomly chosen before starting the game. 

Detectibot (the robot involved in the investigation), moves in a obstacle-free environment charachterised by a perfectly flat floor (without irregularities), within a square-shaped indoor environment 

Concerning the markers we can say that they are positioned in such  a way that the arm can reach them 

All choices were made with the aim of making the system as modular and flexible as possible. Despite this, certain limitations make the system quite unrealistic but functional.

### System's features

Most of them have been already discussed in the Software architecture’s section. 

The project implements the robot behaviour so that it can keep roaming around, looking for clues. This serves for solving the case. 

Indeed, while it navigates through the environment it tries to combine them in order to find a solution. This is where the reasoning & AI module, represented by the [cluedo_kb.py][20], comes imto play

Concerning the architecture, it is centralised and designed in such a way that individual components can be replaced as long as they meet the same required interface 

### System's limitations

Here below, some of the major system limitations are listed:

- the navigation module is not suitable for environments with obstacles as it needs to make a straight line between the starting point and the target.
- since there is no unit that deals explicitly with the marker topology, changing such a topology requires the modification of several parts of the architecture including:
  - the main node that takes into account the topology for being able to do replanning
  - the pddl models, in particular the problem file
  - the oracle, represented by the simulation.cpp node, having hard-coded markers, must be modified to support a new topology
- the architecture could also be executed in a distributed manner by dividing the components over various devices. However, this possibility was not considered during the design of the system. It is therefore necessary to identify possible criticalities in the communication protocol (i.e. to better manage service calls that fail based on the quality of the connection) and to treat them appropriately

### Possible technical Improvements

As for the system limitations, some of the most relevant potential techincal improvements:

- The current KB can be modified to implement the same functionalities on a different ontology system (i.e. Armor); the component can be extended for more accurate  hypotheses processing or for providing, for instance, a ontology backup feature
  
- The current navigation system is rather poor; it should be replaced with a more elaborate navigation system. In particular, the new navigation system should make it possible to achieve a certain orientation as well as a final position.
  
- The manipulation could be replaced with a more advanced node that performs a finer (more precise) control on moveit
  
- The current robot model is quite unstable. It should be adjusted so that it does not oscillate during its movments
  
- the robot needs a lot of manoeuvring space to move; There should be the need of seeking an appropriate navigation algorithm to reduce the necessary manoeuvring space
